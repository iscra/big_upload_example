Solution

Client side
Javascript for uploading, polling progress and rendering it. Available on required platforms. Using standard upload
method honoring browser settings and using HTTP, so it should work with firewalls.

Using ready jQuery helper compatible with the server upload module.

Server side
Specialized "big" upload server showing current progress. Using special module for apache (or nginx).
Saving uploads in filesystem, progress available to query in JSON format. Low overhead per upload running.

Implemented as apache module
